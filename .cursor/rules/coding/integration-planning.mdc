### Step 1: Integration Planning

Before writing any code, understand how the new system integrates with existing infrastructure. This step answers the question: "How does this connect to what already exists?"

**Integration Planning Questions**

```
- What existing services, databases, caches, or APIs does this system need?
- What interfaces (REST, gRPC, message queues, events) must it support?
- What libraries or frameworks are already in use that we can leverage?
- What existing code patterns or utilities can be reused?
- Are there authentication/authorization mechanisms already in place?
- What monitoring or observability infrastructure exists?
- What deployment infrastructure is available?
```

**Integration Planning Output**

```
Integration Plan
================

Dependencies:
- Internal Services: [List with versions and interfaces]
- External Services: [List with API documentation references]
- Libraries: [List of libraries to use, versions]
- Databases: [Database type, connection requirements]
- Caches: [Cache technology, key patterns]
- Message Queues: [Queue technology, topic/exchange names]

Existing Code to Reuse:
- [Component 1]: [Location and how to use it]
- [Component 2]: [Location and how to use it]
[...]

Interface Requirements:
- Input Interfaces: [What interfaces accept input]
- Output Interfaces: [What interfaces produce output]
- Protocol Details: [Any specific protocol requirements]

Configuration:
- Environment Variables: [List of required configuration]
- Secrets Management: [How secrets are accessed]
- Feature Flags: [Any flags needed for gradual rollout]

Observability Integration:
- Logging: [Logging framework and format]
- Metrics: [Metrics to emit and destinations]
- Tracing: [Tracing framework and correlation IDs]
```
